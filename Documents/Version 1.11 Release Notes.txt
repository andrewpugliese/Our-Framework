Configuration (B1.Configuration)

- Custom configuration sections for easier maintenance and testing.
	These sections allow a programmer to have more than 1 configuration option available
	and selecting between each option very efficient/safe (by only changing 1 key).
	This is very helpful when testing against multiple back-end databases.
	These sections are only needed if you intend to use the component.
	
	Lastly, .xsd(schema) files have been provided for each of these sections;  These
	can be used to remove the Information messages generated by the Visual Studio compiler
	when you open an App.Config file.  Instructions to use them will be provided in the help file.
	
	- Object Factory Configuration: provides meta data for the dbProvider helper library.  
		This feature allows the programmer to control what is to be loaded and where it can be found.	
		This is most useful encapsulating api from external sources (e.g. Db vendors like Oracle 11g vs Oracle10g)
		Now there is a way to maintain and deploy both versions
	NOTE: this configuration simply uses the ConnectionKey value (of the AppSettings section of the App.Config)
		; so no new key is required.  See: SampleApp.Config for examples
	
	- Logging Configuration: provides meta data for the logging library options 
		(including multiple targets and parameters for those targets)
	NOTE: this configuration expects a LoggingKey item in the AppSettings section of the App.Config); See: SampleApp.Config for examples
			
	- DbSetup Configuration: provides meta data for the database setup options
		(including the macro substitutions).  
	- Modified unit tests to show examples.
	- Updated documentation
		
DataAccess
- MergeDbCommand - Added capability to specify whether a column is for Update or Insert only
	- Enhanced class and supporting data structures.
	- Modified unit test show example.
- EntityFramework Compatibility
	- New LinqExpression parsing classes
	- Added new BuildSelectDbCmd to DbAccessMgr

Solution Enhancements
- Renamed DataAccess project to match namespace
- Created a Core solution folder and moved the objects into the new folder(this is only within Studio; does not affect actual files)

Session (B1.Session) (SQLServer Only)
- Added 3 classes
	- AppSession (Controls unique application Id startup/checkin/cleanup to provide centralized status and access to Grid Task Processing)
	- UserSession (TBD)
	- SignonControl (contains settings to control status checkin Signon prevention, and ForcedSignoff)
	
- Underlying DDL for SQLServer Only (tables for User and Application Data; documentation in files)
